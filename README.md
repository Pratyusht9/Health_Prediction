# Health Prediction using Daily Lifestyle Parameters

Welcome to the "Health Prediction using Daily Lifestyle Parameters" project! This repository contains code and resources for predicting health outcomes based on daily lifestyle parameters using machine learning techniques.


This project aims to predict health outcomes using machine learning models trained on daily lifestyle parameters. By analyzing various aspects of an individual's lifestyle, we can anticipate potential health conditions and take proactive measures.



The dataset for this project is divided into training and testing subsets:

- Training Dataset: [Train.csv](data/Train.csv)
- Testing Dataset: [Test.csv](data/Test.csv)

The datasets include features related to daily lifestyle parameters such as exercise habits, dietary choices, sleep patterns, and more.



The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation results can be found in the `results` directory after running the testing script.


Contributions are welcome!
